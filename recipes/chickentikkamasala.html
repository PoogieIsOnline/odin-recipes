    <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk yogurt (not Greek)</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp. kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 lb. skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
    <li>3 Tbsp. ghee (clarified butter) or vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 small onion, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
    <li>6 cardamom pods, crushed</li>
    <li>2 dried chiles de arbol or 1/2 tsp. crush red pepper

    <li>1 28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>3/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
    <li>Steamed basmati rice (for serving)</li>
</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine garlic, ginger, turmeric, garam masala, coriander, 
        and cumin in a small bowl. Whisk yogurt, salt, and half 
        of spice mixture in a medium bowl; add chicken and turn 
        to coat. Cover and chill 4-6 hours. Cover and chill remaining 
        spice mixture.</li>
    <li>Heat ghee in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion, 
        tomato paste, cardamom, and chiles and cook, stirring often, 
        until tomato paste has darkened and onion is soft, about 
        5 minutes. Add remaining half of spice mixture and cook, 
        stirring often, until bottom of pot begins to brown, about 
        4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add tomatoes with juices, crushing them with your hands 
        as you add them. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, 
        stirring often and scraping up browned bits from bottom 
        of pot, until sauce thickens, 8-10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add cream and chopped cilantro. Simmer, stirring occasionally, 
        until sauce thickens, 30-40 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, preheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet 
        with foil and set a wire rack inside sheet. Arrange 
        chicken on rack in a single layer. Broil until chicken 
        starts to blacken in spots (it will not be cooked through), 
        about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cut chicken into bite-size pieces, add to sauce, and 
        simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked 
        through, 8-10 minutes. Serve with rice and cilantro 
        sprigs.</li>
